<h1>Remember these steps when pursuing an investment:</h1>

<ol>
    <li>
        <h2>Research</h2>
        <p>
            Start by researching the rental market in your target location.
            Ensure that this location is in close proximity to your own to make maintenance easier to perform and so you have some familiarity with the market area.
            Use your web app to forecast potential rental income, expenses, and mortgage payments for different properties.
            This will help you identify properties with the best potential returns.
        </p>
    </li>

    <li>
        <h2>Budget and Financing</h2>
        <p>
            Determine your budget for the investment. Decide this alongside a professional or take time on your own to calculate what you can afford to pay towards the property.
        </p>
    </li>

    <li>
        <h2>Preliminary Property Selection</h2>
        <p>
            Utilize your PropWise to assess the financial feasibility of different properties based on their forecasted performance.
            Adjust your budget accordingly to find properties that align with your financial goals.
            PropWise can be used to forecast potential rental income, expenses, and mortgage payments for different properties.
            This will help you identify properties with the best potential returns.
        </p>
    </li>

    <li>
        <h2>Legal and Financial Advice</h2>
        <p>
            Once you have a pool of potential properties, seek professional advice from a solicitor and a financial advisor.
            The results from PropWise's calculations will help you make informed decisions during these consultations.
            Discuss the investment rating provided by your app to gain expert opinions.
        </p>
    </li>

    <li>
        <h2>Property Management</h2>
        <p>
            Decide whether you will manage the property yourself or hire a property management company.
            The professional advice alongside PropWise's forecasting can aid in budgeting for management expenses.
            Compare costs and consider the impact on your investment returns.
        </p>
    </li>

    <li>
        <h2>Tenant Screening</h2>
        <p>
            Screen potential tenants thoroughly. Your web app's rental income forecasts can help you assess tenants' ability to meet rent payments.
            Choose tenants who align with your investment objectives.
        </p>
    </li>

    <li>
        <h2>Insurance and Safety</h2>
        <p>
            Get landlord insurance to protect your property.
            Ensure that insurance expenses are accounted for in your overall investment plan.
        </p>
    </li>

    <li>
        <h2>Continuous Monitoring</h2>
        <p>
            Regularly review the property's performance using your PropWise.
            Update your rental forecasts based on real data to make data-driven decisions.
            This will help you adapt your investment strategy as needed.
        </p>
    </li>

    <li>
        <h2>Long-Term Approach</h2>
        <p>
            Embrace a long-term investment strategy, using PropWise alongside expert advice to forecast long-term financial returns and guide future investment decisions.
            Continuously evaluate and adjust your plan based on the app's insights and real-world results.
